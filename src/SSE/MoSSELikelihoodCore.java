/*
 * This class is the analog of 'LikelihoodCore' in beast.evolution.likelihood.
 *
 * Note that unlike 'LikelihoodCore' or any of its daughter classes such
 * as BeerLikelihoodCore, we do not manage all site patterns. We only look at
 * a single site pattern at a time. The loop over site patterns is in the class
 * calling 'MosseLikelihoodCore'.
 *
 * They key difference here is that we have 1 partial array per quantitative trait
 * bin (i.e., there are 'nXbins' partials per nucleotide site). And we don't update
 * these partials (from the substitution model perspective) at internal nodes, but
 * only along branches instead.
 *
 * This means one partial goes in, one partial 'dt' time units before comes out.
