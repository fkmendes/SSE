# SSE


SSE is a [BEAST2](http://beast2.org) package for analyses employing SSE-type models (State-dependent Speciation and Extinction models) in a Bayesian framework.
The SSE package currently implements a well calibrated CLaSSE model (Goldberg and Igic, 2012), with support for its submodels BiSSE, MuSSE and GeoSSE.
We are finalizing the implementation of a stochastic character mapper as in Freyman and Hohna (2018).
