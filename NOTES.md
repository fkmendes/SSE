# Code base notes

This document is meant to guide developers through the code base.
It will:

* Explain the purposes of the different classes, giving some explanation on
relevant implementation details
* Go over the unit tests in a logical order

## Configuring JNI for MoSSE C libraries
Building requires fftw3 and Java 8 on your OS (Ubuntu is recommended).

Install fftw3 on ubuntu  
```
sudo apt-get install -y libfftw3-dev
```

Install Java 8
```
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
```

To build the JNI methods 
```
cd SSE/jni
make
```

To configure your IDE to access the C libraries. 

For IntelliJ, go to **Run -> Edit configurations**

Then, add the JNI path to your Java VM option 
```
-Djava.library.path=/your_path/SSE/jni
```

Running mosse unit tests also require the java library path to be added in the JUnit configuration (following same steps as above).

*Note: Instructions for Mac and Windows OS coming soon.*

## QuaSSE unit tests

### QuaSSEFunctionsTest

See `validation/r_scripts/QuaSSEFunctionsTest_JUnitTest.R` for where
expectations come from.

* `testLogistic`: tests the LogisticFunction class, which converts an
  x (continuous trait) value into a y (macroevolutionary parameter, e.g.,
  the birth rate) value

* `testConstant`: tests the ConstantLinkFn class, which converts an
  x (continuous trait) value and maps to a constant scalar value for y
  (a macroevolutionary parameter, e.g., the death rate)

* `testQu2MacroevolFailLogistic`: tests LogisticFunction throws an
  exception if the number of bins for x and y differ

* `testQu2MacroevolFailConstant`: tests ConstantLinkFn throws an
  exception if the number of bins for x and y differ

### PropagatesQuaSSETest

See `validation/r_script/PropagatesQuaSSETest_JUnitTest.R` for where
expectations come from

None of the tests here depend on, nor test, the initialization of
likelihood classes (i.e., we do not test if arrays are declared with
the right dimensions and correctly populated with initial values).

* `testPropagateTimeOneChQuaSSETest`: tests
  SSEUtils.propagateEandDinTQuaSSEinPlace.
  
  It uses a manually creates array of random values as input, with a
  total of 32 bins. It checks that both E's and D's are propagated in
  time correctly.

* `testPropagateTimeOneChQuaSSETestSSTJavaFftService`: tests
  SSEUtils.propagateEandDinTQuasseInPlaceSSTJavaFftService.
  
  It uses a manually created array of random values, spread over an
  array while skipping even indices, as required by SST's
  JavaFftService (which is tested elsewhere!).
  
  (Note that we do not use SST in this test, this is just to make
  sure this method skips indices correctly.)

* `testMakeNormalKernInPlaceAndFftAndIfft`: tests both
  SSEUtils.makeNormalKernelInPlace and FFTing with JTransforms.
  
  The Normal kernel assigns a different probability to each of
  'nXbins' bins. Note that x here is not a value a continuous trait
  can have, but instead, a certain delta-trait-value. So most of the
  probability mass of this kernel is centered around zero (we are
  assuming the continuous trait evolves according to a Brownian motion
  model).
  
  Now for some technical reason, we put the bins that would have the
  highest probabilities in the first 'nRightFlankBins' to the left,
  and the last 'nLeftFlankBins' to the right.
  The middle x bins are assigned probabilities of zero.
  
  This test assumes 32 bins and 2 flanking bins to the left, and to
  the right.

* `testMakeNormalKernInPlaceAndFftAndIfftSSTModalFftService`: tests
  both SSEUtils.makeNormalKernelInPlace and FFTing with the SST
  library, using RealArray methods (which invoke ModalFfftService).
  
  (See test above for more details.)

* `testConvolve`:

* `testConvolveSSTModalFftService`:

* `testConvolveSSTJavaFftService`:

* `testPropagateChOneCh32QuaSSE`:

* `testPropagateChOneCh1024QuaSSE`:

* `testPropagateChOneCh4096QuaSSE`:

* `testPropagateChOneCh4096QuaSSEModalFftService`:

* `testPropagateChOneCh4096QuaSSEJavaFftService`:
